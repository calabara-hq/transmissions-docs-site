Transmissions is a suite of composable, audited, NounsDAO funded contracts and developer tools that power multiplayer onchain applications - 
allowing communitites to design grant programs, bounties, decentralized galleries, and other onchain apps.

## Features
Channels are the core entity of the protocol. Channels extend the ERC-1155 standard with the following features out of the box.


- **Custom interaction logic**. Read from any onchain data source to govern users ability to create and mint tokens in the channel.
- **Custom fees**. Build your own mint pricing and protocol reward splits for the channel.
- **Push-style protocol rewards**. Protocol rewards flow directly to recipients without claiming.
- **Token intents**. Create tokens in the collection gaslessly
- **Onchain sponsorships**. Receive rewards for sponsoring intents onchain
- **ERC-20 Minting**




## Transport Layers

Transport layers are application specific contracts that sit atop channels. The transport layer receives messages from the channel, and runs the application logic for the intended use case.
There are currently 2 transport layers that users can choose from when creating a channel: **Infinite** and **Finite**.

**Infinite Channels** are a never ending collection of posts. They can be used to create galleries, zines, application feeds, and more. E.g. mintboards on uplink.wtf are infinite channels.

**Finite Channels** are timed collections that accept reward conditions and escrow ETH or ERC-20 rewards. They can be used to create bounties, grant rounds, voting systems and more. E.g. contests on uplink.wtf are finite channels, where new tokens are entries and mints are votes.


The protocol works by extending the ERC-1155 standard with features that create a structured environment for multiplayer collaboration. Channels are the core entity of the protocol, and can be used to create a variety of applications.

## Use Cases
- **Grant Programs**
- **Bounties**
- **Multiplayer NFT collections**
- **Other Cooperative Apps**

These tools are made possible by Base and NounsDAO - a decentralized autonomous organization that funds public goods.
The protocol is designed and maintained by [Calabara](https://www.calabara.com/). We'd like to thank [0xSplits](https://splits.org), [Viem](https://viem.sh), [Zora](https://zora.co), and [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf) for design inspiration and their contributions to open source software.
