title: Introduction
description: 'Transmissions is a suite of composable, audited, NounsDAO funded contracts and developer tools that enable cooperative applications - allowing cohorts to permissionlessly build grant programs, bounties, decentralized galleries, and other onchain apps.'

The protocol works by extending the ERC-1155 standard with features that create a structured environment for multiplayer collaboration. Channels are the core entity of the protocol, and can be used to create a variety of applications.

## Use Cases
- **Grant Programs**: Decentralized funding mechanisms with collaborative decision-making.
- **Bounties**: Tools for creating and managing incentives within communities.
- **Decentralized Galleries**: Platforms for curating and displaying digital assets onchain.
- **Other Cooperative Apps**: Infrastructure for building multiplayer applications and incentives.


## Features

- **Custom interaction logic**. Read from any onchain data source to govern who is allowed to create and mint tokens in the channel.
- **Custom fees**. Build your own mint pricing and protocol reward splits for the channel.
- **Push-style protocol rewards**. Protocol rewards flow directly to recipients without claiming.
- **Token intents**. Create tokens in the collection gaslessly
- **Onchain sponsorships**. Receive rewards for sponsoring intents onchain
- **ERC-20 Minting**
- **Open Source**
- **Flexible**. BYO interaction logic, fee, and transport layer contracts


## Transport Layers

Operators may want to run channels in different "modes" depending on the desired use case. This can be done by specifying a transport layer for the channel. The transport layer receives messages from the channel, and runs the application logic for the intended use case.
There are currently 2 transport layers that users can choose from when creating a channel: **Infinite** and **Finite**.

**Infinite Channels** are a never ending collection of posts. They can be used to create galleries, zines, application feeds, and more. E.g. mintboards on uplink.wtf are infinite channels.

**Finite Channels** are timed collections that accept reward conditions and escrow ETH or ERC-20 rewards. They can be used to create bounties, grant rounds, voting systems and more. E.g. contests on uplink.wtf are finite channels, where new tokens are entries and mints are votes.
